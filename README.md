# Hi, I’m Thejal 👋
M.Tech Cyber Security student | IAM & Okta intern | Java & Python.
I’m deeply interested in cryptography, cybersecurity, and secure systems design. I enjoy exploring algorithms like AES, RSA, and hashing functions. My current focus is on understanding the linear complexities and statistical behaviour of stream ciphers.
